<h1 align="center">Smile Makeovers</h1>
## Project Overview

This project is part of my Task 1 for the Future Interns UI/UX Design Internship (January 2026). The goal was to redesign a landing page for a local service business—Smile Makeovers—with a focus on high conversion and lead generation.
Design Goal

The primary objective was to transform a standard dental clinic website into a welcoming, trustworthy digital experience. I focused on making the service feel "pain-free" and approachable to reduce patient anxiety.
Key Features

    Friendly Visuals: I used a custom 3D tooth mascot to give the brand a friendly and memorable personality.

    Color Palette: Used a combination of soft blues and greens to evoke a sense of cleanliness, professionalism, and calm.

    Clear CTAs: Prominent "Book Free Consultation" buttons are placed strategically to drive user action.

    Responsive Design: The repository includes designs for both laptop and mobile views to ensure a seamless experience across devices.
